⚽ FIFA World Cup Insights Dashboard
🎯 Short Description / Purpose
This Tableau FIFA World Cup Dashboard is a dynamic and interactive data visualization project designed for football analysts, sports journalists, and enthusiasts. It offers a compelling visual analysis of historical tournament performance, enabling users to track team trends, analyze match results, and explore player statistics across various FIFA World Cup events. The dashboard's purpose is to transform complex, multi-tournament data into easily digestible insights for strategic performance comparisons and historical exploration.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following core tools and technologies:

📊 Tableau Desktop – The primary platform used for data blending, creating calculated fields, and designing the interactive dashboards and sheets.

🧠 Tableau Calculated Fields / LOD Expressions – Employed for creating advanced, aggregated metrics essential for football analysis (e.g., win percentages, average goals per match, historical performance indexing).

📂 Tableau Hyper – The project utilizes a Tableau Hyper data extract for efficient, high-performance querying and analysis of the underlying historical data.
The data source is stored internally within the workbook: Data/TableauTemp/#TableauTemp_1bnll9d1ttputm1dylj6r0mj8qim.hyper.

📁 File Format – Developed as a Tableau Packaged Workbook (.twbx), containing both the visualizations and the required data extract for portability and easy viewing.

📊 Data Source
The project utilizes a historical dataset focused on the FIFA World Cup, as indicated by the file name and content.

Source: Historical FIFA World Cup Data / Public Sports Data Repositories.

Data Content: The dataset is expected to contain detailed records from multiple tournaments, likely including:

Tournament Information: Year, Host Country, and Number of Participating Teams.

Team Performance: Match Results (Wins, Losses, Draws), Goals Scored, and Goals Conceded.

Geographical Data: Country/Nation performance analysis.

Player Statistics (Hypothetical): Top Goal Scorers, Appearances, etc.

✨ Features / Highlights
The primary goal of this dashboard is to provide clear, actionable insights into the history of the FIFA World Cup.

Business Problem: Analyzing complex, large-scale historical tournament data to identify long-term trends and comparative team performance is challenging using static reports or raw data.

Goal of the Dashboard: To create an intuitive, drill-down interface for exploring World Cup history, simplifying team comparisons, and pinpointing key competitive metrics.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals (Hypothetical)
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Highlighting total tournament goals, overall average goals per match, and team-specific win/loss records.

Historical Performance Chart: A trendline showing a selected country's total goals or win percentage across different World Cup years to visualize long-term dominance or decline.

Geographic Participation Map: A choropleth map showing World Cup participation or total goals scored by country, enabling a geographical analysis of football success.

Top Scorer/Team Analysis: Bar charts and tables ranking the Top Teams by win count or the Top Players by goal count across selected tournaments.

Match Result Breakdown: A matrix or small multiples view to analyze the distribution of match outcomes (e.g., goals scored in specific stages like the knockout rounds).
